# SQL-Data-Warehouse-Project

## Goal:
Build a data warehouse by extracting data from Excel and loading it into SQL Server for structured analysis.

## Description:
This project involved designing and implementing a data warehouse from scratch using SQL Server, with Excel files serving as the data source. I created a star schema with a central fact table connected to multiple dimension tables. The ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process was executed using Excel and T-SQL to extract, clean, and load the data into SQL Server. The final model was optimized for analytics and reporting, providing a strong foundation for future BI tools such as Tableau.

## Skills:
- Data Warehousing  
- ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)  
- SQL  
- Dimensional Modeling  

## Technology:
- Excel  
- SQL Server  
- SSMS (SQL Server Management Studio)   

## Results:
Successfully deployed a fully functional data warehouse structure, showcasing best practices in data integration and dimensional modeling.
